# Thin Section Stitcher v1.0

This Fiji/ImageJ macro will stitch PPL, XPL and FLO images taken with a petrographic microscope.
Currently, this macro only supports an overlap of 20% between images.

To optimize storage, this macro will create a temporary folder, where intermediary images will be stored, which will be cleared once the macro finished running.
